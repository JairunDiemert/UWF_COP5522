for some reason the "time" command does not format properly when run as part of a bash script
run unoptimized montecarlo like
time ./montecarlo <desired number of iterations>

run optimized montecarlo like
time mpirun -np <desired number of processes> ./montecarlo_opt1 <desired number of iterations>
