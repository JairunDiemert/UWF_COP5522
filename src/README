Instructions for running code:

run unoptimized montecarlo like
time ./montecarlo <desired number of iterations>

run optimized montecarlo like
time mpirun -np <desired number of processes> ./montecarlo_opt1 <desired number of iterations>

In similar fashion to the previous updates. run as follows

time mpirun -np <desired number of processes> ./montecarlo_opt2 <desired number of iterations>

time mpirun -np <desired number of processes> ./montecarlo_opt3 <desired number of iterations>
